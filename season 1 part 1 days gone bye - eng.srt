1
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,660
Little girl?

2
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,795
I'm a policeman.

3
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:33,777
Little girl!

4
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,415
Don't be afraid, okay?

5
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:44,873
Little girl?

6
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,005
TEAM STAYIN' ALIVE

7
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,950
What's the difference
between men and women?

8
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,433
- This a joke?
- No. Serious.

9
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:07,757
Never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

10
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:11,087
They're born thinking
the switch only goes one way... on.

11
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:15,076
They're struck blind
the second when they leave a room.

12
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:18,193
Every woman I ever have let a key,
swear to God,

13
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:22,196
I come home, house's all lit up.

14
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,509
My job, apparently, because...

15
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:29,829
because my chromosomes are different,
is I have got to walk through that house

16
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,540
and turn off every single light
this chick left on.

17
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,985
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

18
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,082
Reverend Shane's preachin' to ya,
now, boy.

19
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:42,212
Then, the same chick minds you,

20
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,219
she'll bitch about global warming.

21
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,724
There's one Reverend Shane wants
to quote from the Guy Gospel saying,

22
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:55,001
"Darlin', maybe you and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

23
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,465
"just figured out
that the light switch goes both ways,

24
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:01,444
"maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

25
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,574
- You say that?
- The polite version.

26
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:07,734
Still, man.

27
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,970
That earns me this look of loathing
you would not believe.

28
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,707
And that's when
the Exorcist voice pops out,

29
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,752
"You sound just like
my damn father!"

30
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:22,382
"Always yelling about the power bill,
telling me 'turn off the damn light!'"

31
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,176
- What do you say to that?
- What I want to say is,

32
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,414
"Bitch, you mean to tell me
you been hearing this your entire life

33
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,432
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?"

34
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,146
I don't actually say that, thought.

35
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,832
That would be bad.

36
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,080
- I go with the polite version.
- Very wise.

37
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,710
How's it with Lori, man?

38
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:55,581
She's good at turning off lights.
Really good.

39
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:59,127
- I'm the one who sometimes forgets.
- Not what I meant.

40
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:06,524
- We didn't have a great night.
- Look, man. I may have...

41
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:09,776
failed to amuse with my sermon,
but I did try.

42
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,862
Less you could do is speak.

43
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:19,022
That's what she always says.
"Speak. Speak."

44
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:25,025
You'd think I was the closed-mouth
son of a bitch ever to hear her tell it.

45
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:29,535
Do you express your thoughts?

46
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,377
Do you share your feelings?
That kind of stuff?

47
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,194
Thing is...

48
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,057
Lately, whenever I try,

49
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:46,153
everything I say makes her impatient.
Like she didn't wanna hear it after all.

50
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:52,079
It's like she's pissed at me
all the time and I don't know why.

51
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,142
That's just shit couples go through.

52
00:07:56,587 --> 00:07:58,043
It's a phase.

53
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,206
The last thing she said
this morning,

54
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:09,028
"Sometimes, I wonder
if you even care about us at all."

55
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,688
She said that in front of our kid.

56
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:18,261
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

57
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:24,536
The difference
between men and women?

58
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,772
I would never say
something that cruel to her.

59
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,237
Certainly not in front of Carl.

60
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:40,186
<i>All available units,
high speed pursuit in progress,</i>

61
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,362
<i>Linden County
requests local assistance.</i>

62
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,857
<i>Highway 18 eastbound, GTA, ADW,</i>

63
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,819
<i>2-17, 2-4-3.
Advise extreme caution.</i>

64
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,376
<i>Suspects are two males Caucasian.</i>

65
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,171
<i>Be advise.
One Linden County officer is wounded.</i>

66
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:30,903
<i>Dispatch unit 1, unit 3,</i>

67
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,115
we are 10-97 and code 100,
Highway 18, EB of interstate,

68
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,550
<i>please advise.</i>

69
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:55,955
Sounds like they chase all these idiots
up and down every back road we got.

70
00:09:56,122 --> 00:10:00,433
Maybe we'll get on one of them video
shows? What do you think?

71
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,520
Leon, stay focused, keep a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

72
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:14,707
Would be kinda cool.
Get on one of them shows.

73
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,537
Holy shit!

74
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,937
- Gun! Gun!
- Put it down!

75
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,508
Put the gun down!

76
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:04,128
Rick?

77
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,227
I'm all right.

78
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,954
I saw you get tagged.
That scared the hell out of me.

79
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,628
Me too.

80
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:18,774
That son of a bitch shot me.
You believe that?

81
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,782
- It catch you in your vest?
- Yeah.

82
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:27,038
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened. Ever.

83
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,689
You understand?

84
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,731
He's hit!

85
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,778
Leon, get that ambulance down here

86
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,028
and tell him
there's an officer's down!

87
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,681
You look at me,
you stay with me, you hear me?

88
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:51,979
Stay with me.

89
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:15,546
Hey, buddy.

90
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,841
We still here. We still hanging in.

91
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:29,463
I'm sorry, man. I say the same crap
every time I come in here.

92
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,995
Everybody pitching all these.

93
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:39,046
They want me to bring 'em down.

94
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,806
They hope you come back real soon.

95
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:48,724
Linda and Diane from dispatch
picked these out.

96
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,099
I can tell.

97
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:56,685
I'm just gonna set these
on your side table, okay?

98
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,580
That vase. That's something special.

99
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,382
Fess up. You steal it
from your grandma Jean's house.

100
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:16,160
Hope you left her
that spoon collection.

101
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:25,711
Shane?

102
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,778
Shane? You in the john?

103
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,445
Nurse, help!

104
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,594
Nurse! Help!

105
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:44,054
Lori?

106
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,819
Carl?

107
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:44,695
Is this real? Am I here?

108
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:53,233
Wake... wake up.

109
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:10,152
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Carl...

110
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:13,488
Carl, I found you.

111
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,269
Daddy, I got this sumbitch.
I'm gonna smack him dead.

112
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:26,793
- He say something? I though he did.
- He called me Carl.

113
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,461
You know they don't talk.

114
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:31,552
Mister? What's that bandage for?

115
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:35,803
- What?
- What kind of wound?

116
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,136
You answer me, damn you!

117
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,496
What's your wound?

118
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,263
Tell me or I will kill you.

119
00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:14,100
Got that bandage changed now.
Was pretty rank.

120
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,492
What was it? The wound?

121
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:20,885
Gunshot.

122
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,720
What else? Anything?

123
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:26,688
Gunshot ain't enough?

124
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,774
Look, I ask and you answer.

125
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,311
It's common courtesy, right?

126
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:39,464
Did you get bit?

127
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,536
- Bit?
- Bit. Chewed.

128
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:46,539
Maybe scratched.
Anything like that.

129
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:48,687
No, I got shot.

130
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,827
Just shot. As far as I know.

131
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,914
Just let me.

132
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,597
He's cold enough.

133
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:05,545
Fever would have killed you by now.

134
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:09,153
- I don't think I have one.
- Be hard to miss.

135
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:18,244
Take a moment.
Look how sharp it is.

136
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:20,812
Try anything.

137
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:24,523
I will kill you with this.
Don't you think I won't.

138
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,105
Come on out when you're able.

139
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:15,841
This place.

140
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:18,581
Fred and Cindy Drake's.

141
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,910
Never met them.

142
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,728
I've been here. This is their place.

143
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:26,189
It was empty when we got here.

144
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:32,148
Don't do that.
They'll see the light.

145
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:35,534
There's more of them
out there than usual.

146
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,698
I never should have
fire that gun today.

147
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,946
Sound draws them.
Now they're all over the street.

148
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,255
Stupid. Using the gun.

149
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:50,413
But all happened so fast.
I didn't think.

150
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,540
You shot that man today.

151
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,168
- Man?
- Weren't no man.

152
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,045
What was that out of your mouth?

153
00:29:58,134 --> 00:29:59,464
It wasn't a man.

154
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,932
You shot him.
In the street. Out front. A man.

155
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,498
Friend, you need glasses.
It was a walker.

156
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,632
Come on.

157
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:09,955
Sit down. Before you fall down.

158
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:12,933
Here.

159
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,484
Blessing.

160
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:38,793
Father we thank Thee
for this food, Thy blessings.

161
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:43,971
We ask you to watch over us
in this crazy days. Amen.

162
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:53,393
Mister, you know what's going on?

163
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:54,944
I woke up today.

164
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:57,709
In a hospital.

165
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:01,348
Came home. That's all I know.

166
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:08,157
- But you know about the dead people?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

167
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,786
Out on the loading docks.
Piled in trucks.

168
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,462
No, not the one they put down.

169
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:16,820
The ones they didn't, the walkers.

170
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:20,003
Like the one I shot today.

171
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,873
'Cause he'd ripped into you.

172
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,340
Try to eat you,
take some flesh, at least.

173
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:27,802
If this is the first
you're hearing it,

174
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,539
I know how it must sound.

175
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:35,310
They're out there now,
in the street?

176
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,314
They get more active
after dark sometimes.

177
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:44,230
Maybe it's the cool air or maybe
it's just me firing that gun today.

178
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,595
But we'll be fine
as long as we stay quiet.

179
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:49,819
Probably wandered off by morning.

180
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:53,457
Listen.

181
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,504
One thing I do know,
don't you get bit.

182
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:02,086
I saw your bandages,
that's what we were afraid of.

183
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:06,819
Bites kills you.
The fever burns you out.

184
00:32:06,986 --> 00:32:08,735
But then after a while...

185
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:11,924
You come back.

186
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,521
I've seen it happen.

187
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,517
Carl.

188
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,042
Your son?

189
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,126
You said his name today.

190
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:46,567
He's a little younger than your boy.

191
00:32:47,284 --> 00:32:48,657
He's with his mom?

192
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:52,136
I hope so.

193
00:32:57,753 --> 00:32:59,226
Did you ask him?

194
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:03,398
You gunned shot.

195
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,644
We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a bank robber.

196
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:15,242
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger.
Ka-pow.

197
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,646
Sheriff's deputy.

198
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,212
It's okay. Dad is here.

199
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,781
It's nothing.

200
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,092
One of them must have bumped a car.

201
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:34,366
- You sure?
- Happened once before.

202
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:37,240
Went off a few minutes.

203
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,185
Get the light, Duane.

204
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,159
The blue one on the street.
Same one as last time.

205
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:01,637
I think we're okay.

206
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,278
That noise.
Won't it bring more of them?

207
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,396
Nothing we can do about it now.

208
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,347
Just have to wait it out
till morning.

209
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:18,749
She's here.

210
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,413
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

211
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,912
I said go. Come on.

212
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,383
Quiet.

213
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:35,414
Come on. Quiet.

214
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:02,021
It's okay. Cry into the pillow.
Do you remember?

215
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:44,086
She...

216
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:49,621
She died in the other room.
On that bed.

217
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,971
And I... couldn't do about it.

218
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:57,166
That fever, man.

219
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:00,783
Her skin gave off heat
like a furnace.

220
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:11,571
I should have put her down.
I know that.

221
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,980
You know what?
I just didn't have it in me.

222
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:23,765
She's the mother of my child.

223
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,793
Are we sure they're dead?

224
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,604
I have to ask. Least, one more time.

225
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:56,691
They're dead.

226
00:36:57,284 --> 00:37:01,018
Except for something in the brain.
That's why it's gotta be the head.

227
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:27,698
You all right?

228
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:30,783
Need a moment.

229
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:38,972
They're alive. My wife and son.

230
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,281
At least they were when the left.

231
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:42,886
How can you know?

232
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:47,190
- By the look of this place.
- I found empty drawers in the bedroom.

233
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:48,933
They packed a few clothes.

234
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:50,923
Enough to travel.

235
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,220
Anybody could have broken in here
and stole clothes.

236
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,355
See the framed photos on the walls?

237
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,777
Neither do I. Some random thief
take those too, you think?

238
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:08,870
My photo albums, family pictures.
All gone.

239
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:11,852
Photo albums.

240
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:20,993
My wife... same thing.

241
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,818
There I am packing survival gears.
She's grabbing photo al...

242
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,526
They're in Atlanta, I bet.

243
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:35,248
That's right.

244
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,608
- Why there?
- Refugee center.

245
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,615
A huge one, they said.
Before the broadcasts stopped.

246
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,760
Military protection. Food. Shelter.

247
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,910
They told people to go there.
Said it'd be the safest.

248
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,078
Plus they got that disease place.

249
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,740
Center for Disease Control.

250
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:56,042
Said they were working out
how to solve this thing.

251
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,112
Gas line been down
for maybe a month.

252
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,529
Station got his own propane system.

253
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:32,704
Pilon's still on.

254
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:41,917
That feels good, right?

255
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:55,559
Duane, dressing room back there.

256
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,671
What do you say, Duane?

257
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,643
Thank you.

258
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,871
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

259
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:10,290
Safer, anyway. People.

260
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,784
That's where we were heading.

261
00:40:14,193 --> 00:40:17,623
Things got crazy.
You can't believe the panic.

262
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,510
Streets weren't fit to be on.
Then my...

263
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:25,592
My wife couldn't travel.

264
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,727
Not with her hurt.
Had to find a place and lay low.

265
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:30,636
And after she died.

266
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:35,634
We just stayed hunkered down.

267
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:40,221
I guess we just froze in place.

268
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:43,614
Plan to move on?

269
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,284
Haven't work up to it yet.

270
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:59,274
A lot of it's gone missing.

271
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,553
Daddy, can I learn to shoot?
I'm old enough.

272
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,464
You'll learn. But we'll do it carefully.
Teach you to respect the weapon.

273
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,385
That's right. It's not a toy. You pull
the trigger, you have to mean it.

274
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,616
Always remember that, Duane.

275
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:17,875
Here.

276
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:20,429
Load up.

277
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:27,860
Take that one. Nothing fancy.

278
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:30,016
Scope's accurate.

279
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:44,558
Conserve your ammo.

280
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:48,009
Goes faster than you think.
Especially at target practice.

281
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,493
Take this for the car.

282
00:41:54,202 --> 00:41:57,847
- You sure you won't come along?
- A few more days.

283
00:41:58,223 --> 00:42:01,637
By then, Duane will know how to shoot
and I won't be so rusty.

284
00:42:08,688 --> 00:42:10,379
You got one battery.

285
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:13,211
I'll turn mine on
a few minutes of every day at dawn.

286
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:15,741
You get up there,
that's how you find me.

287
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:19,078
- You think ahead.
- Can't afford not to.

288
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,747
- Not anymore.
- One more thing.

289
00:42:22,198 --> 00:42:24,579
They may not seem like much,
one at a time.

290
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,151
But in a group?
All riled up and hungry?

291
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,115
- There you watch your ass.
- You too.

292
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:35,427
You're a good man, Rick.
I hope you find your wife and son.

293
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,779
Be seeing you, Duane.
Take care of your old man.

294
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:55,013
Leon Basset.

295
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:03,064
Didn't think much of him.
Careless and dumb.

296
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:06,640
But I can't leave him like this.

297
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,380
You know they'll hear the shot.

298
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,168
- Let's not be here when they show up.
- Let's go, son. Come on.

299
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:52,891
You read your comic books a while.
I'll be upstairs.

300
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,154
- Daddy?
- It's all right, Duane.

301
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,150
You stay there, son.
Don't you come up here.

302
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:27,458
Jenny.

303
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:30,985
Come on, baby.

304
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:04,284
I'm sorry this happened to you.

305
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,453
Come on! Come on!

306
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:55,951
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

307
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:59,017
Will be approaching Atlanta
on Highway 85.

308
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:02,505
If anybody reads, please respond.

309
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:08,021
Hello. Hello.
Can anybody hear my voice?

310
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:14,269
Anybody out there?
Anybody here? Please respond.

311
00:50:16,757 --> 00:50:18,056
Can you hear my voice?

312
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:20,851
<i>Hello, can anybody hear my voice?</i>

313
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:27,599
- <i>... can you hear my voice?</i>
- Yes, I can hear you. Over.

314
00:50:28,454 --> 00:50:30,777
<i>If anybody reads, please respond.</i>

315
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:35,743
Broadcasting on emergency channel.
Approaching Atlanta on Highway 85.

316
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,724
If anybody reads, please respond.

317
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,502
We're just outside the city.

318
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:50,881
- I couldn't warm him.
- Try and raise him again.

319
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,842
Come on, son.
You know best how to work this thing.

320
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,316
Hello, hello. Is the person
who called still on the air?

321
00:51:02,232 --> 00:51:04,807
This is officer Shane Walsh
broadcasting to unknown person.

322
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,396
Please respond.

323
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:14,162
He's gone.

324
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,283
There are others. It's not just us.

325
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:21,411
We knew there would be.
That's why we have the scanner on.

326
00:51:21,796 --> 00:51:23,080
Lot of good it's doing.

327
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,281
I've been saying for a week
we have to put signs out on 85.

328
00:51:26,448 --> 00:51:28,139
Warn people away from the city.

329
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:30,754
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

330
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,355
Haven't had time.

331
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:35,731
I think we need to make time.

332
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:39,935
That's a luxury we can't afford.

333
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:42,223
We are surviving here,
we are day to day.

334
00:51:43,296 --> 00:51:47,354
- Who would you proposed we send?
- I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

335
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,768
Nobody goes anywhere alone.
You know that.

336
00:51:55,026 --> 00:51:56,262
Officer.

337
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:59,912
Go and take a sit, buddy.
You all right. Come on.

338
00:52:04,273 --> 00:52:05,975
Wait, you're pissed at me?

339
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:10,711
Be pissed at me all you want,
it's not gonna change anything.

340
00:52:12,742 --> 00:52:15,906
I'm not putting you in danger.
I'm not doing it for anything.

341
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:19,695
If I make you feel like sometimes
you want to slap me upside the head...

342
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:22,973
Tell you what, you feel that need,
you go right ahead. I'm right here.

343
00:52:26,106 --> 00:52:30,427
You cannot walk off like that
all half-cocked.

344
00:52:30,755 --> 00:52:34,359
If you're not doing it for my sake
nor for your sake, fine. But just...

345
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:36,896
You do it for him.

346
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,826
That boy's been through too much.
He won't lose his mother too, okay?

347
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:47,414
I'm a good mom.

348
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:52,605
You tell me you okay.

349
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:01,033
Wasn't that hard.

350
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,198
Mom?

351
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:27,503
What's up, buddy?
She's in there. Go on.

352
00:53:30,613 --> 00:53:33,043
I don't want you to worry.
Your mom is not going anywhere.

353
00:53:37,165 --> 00:53:39,043
Go finish your chores.

354
00:54:22,832 --> 00:54:24,000
Hello?

355
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,505
Police officer out here!

356
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:31,877
Can I borrow some gas?

357
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:51,214
Anybody home?

358
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:22,277


359
00:56:37,878 --> 00:56:39,381
Easy, now. Easy.

360
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:43,044
Not gonna hurt you.
Nothing like that.

361
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:47,183
More like a proposal.

362
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,761
Atlanta is just down the road a ways.
It's safe there.

363
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:54,494
Food, shelter, people.

364
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,493
Other horses too, I bet.

365
00:56:58,538 --> 00:56:59,959
How's that sound?

366
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,917
Here we go. Good boy.

367
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:08,835
Now come with me? Come.

368
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,896
Let's go easy, okay?

369
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:24,407
I haven't done this for years.

370
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:31,906
No... Easy, boy!

371
00:57:53,242 --> 00:57:54,468
Let's go.

372
00:59:47,027 --> 00:59:50,291
Steady. There's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

373
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:43,921
Lori, Carl. I'm sorry.

374
01:05:08,535 --> 01:05:09,697
<i>Hey you.</i>

375
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,478
<i>Dumbass.</i>

376
01:05:15,673 --> 01:05:18,755
<i>Hey, you in the tank.
You cozy in there?</i>
